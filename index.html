    <h3><u>Gaming and Battery Performance</u></h3>
    <p>As the laptop has a 4GB dedicated Grphics memory gaming on this laptop with a 144Hz screen is just Amazing.I tested out Games such as Forza Horizon 4,GTA V,Red Dead Detemption 2,COD Warzone. and while playing these games there wasn't a single bit of lag or a single frame dropped,and the average FPS for these games were between 80-90(Games were played while charging) which is great for laptop below 60k</p>
    <p>The laptop has an 78 WHr Battery,which is decent enough to get through 4-5 hours on light usage such as watching videos and internet surfing. And on heavy use the battery struggles and the backup drops down to 1.5-2Hrs of Screen on Time.</p>
